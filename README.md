 THIS IS MADE WITH https://127.0.0.1:5500 AS BASE URL IN MIND BECAUSE OF THE VSCODE LIVE SERVER. IF YOU WANT TO TEST/RUN THIS 
 CODE WITH IT WORKING 100% I HIGLY RECOMMEND RUNNING IT WITH VSCODE AND THE LIVE SERVER EXTENTION. I MADE THE URL'S EASLY CHANGEABLE 
 ON THE TOP OF THE CODE ALTHOUGH I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING IT THAT WAY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS DON'T MIND REACHING OUT
